# giftastic

Welcome, and thank you for taking the time to look at my Giftastic Application. The purpose of this app is to allow the users to search for gifs, (image files) based on any of the fifty states, using an API (in this case being https://api.giphy.com) and using a simple search button click generate all gifs that are related to that state in a static form.

Each time a new state is searched and the button is clicked that option will permanently append to the page, and can be clicked on again at any time in order to see those gifs. The gifs will load originally in a static format and soon move to be animated, should the user click on any individual gif it will animate, should the user click the now animated gif again, it will return to its original static form.

The gifs will prepend to what has already been shown, pushing down earlier click results towards the bottom of the page and putting new searches above it. Should the user reclick something they are already on however, nothing new will appear. 

I hope you enjoy playing around with this application and find out what Gifs each state, (particularly yours) has to offer!
